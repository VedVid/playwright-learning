This repository contains my attempts to learn test automation with Playwright, Python and Pytest.

After dabbling with absolute basics and finishing official Playwright tutorial, I found out excellent list of websites designed to practice testing on: https://github.com/BMayhew/awesome-sites-to-test-on

Currently I am working through https://www.automationexercise.com/.

Tests for every website I tackled on will be contained in separate directory.

One can either run all tests in repository by using `pytest` command in the root directory, or `pytest directory/` e.g. `pytest /automation_exercise` to run a set of tests limited to a single website.

Please note that `automation_exercise` as a first website I practice test automation, and the tests are kind of kitchen sink â€“ some test are written entirely by hand, other tests are generated by `playwright codegen` tool and simply copied, and still others are generated by codegen tool then adjusted by hand. That is also a reason that while pytest runs tests in headless mode by default, some tests will spawn web browser anyway.
